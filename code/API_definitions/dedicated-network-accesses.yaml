  title: Dedicated Network - Accesses
  description: |

    This API allows for requesting network access for devices. A device is identified by the CAMARA _device object_, containing either an MSIDSN or a Network Access Identifier. For more information about the Dedicated Networks APIs, see the _GeneralDescription_ document in the Dedicated Networks [repository](https://github.com/camaraproject/DedicatedNetworks/).

    A Device Access represents the permission for a specific device or for a group of specific devices to use a Dedicated Network's reserved connectivity resources. Only devices for which a Device Access resource has been created can use the connectivity resources allocated for that network. The usage of resources can be tailored to each device within the constraints of the applicable Network Profile.

    A device is identified by the CAMARA `device` object, where at least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    Notes:
    1. Support for using an IP address as device identifier is not recommended when the IP address may change. The API invoker may not be able to associate the accesses resource with the targeted device anymore.<br>Further, the device may be offline at time of Accesses API usage, thus, no IP address assigned.
    1. Network Access Identifier is defined for future use and will not be supported with this version of the API.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the `device`, which therefore MUST be provided either individually or in a device group.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided nor a device group can be used, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.
    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same `device` is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Creating a device access

    A Device Access is created by performing a `POST` operation on the `/accesses` endpoint.

    The API Consumer provides the following information

    - the networkId to which access is being given

    - either the identifier of the device - either in `device` object or in the token (see "Identifying the device from the access token" above) - or the device group identifier (see "Creating a device group")

    - optionally, a default QoS Profile can be set for the device(s) (see Network Profiles section in the dedicated-network-profiles API in the [Dedicated Networks repository](https://github.com/camaraproject/DedicatedNetworks/)).

    - optionally, a subset of QoS Profiles from this network can be provided to further restrict which QoS Profiles the device(s) can access

    The API returns an accessId which is needed to query the status of the Device Access (GET /accesses/{accessId}) and to delete Access (DELETE accesses/{accessId}).

    # Querying one or more device accesses

    All available device accesses of the API consumer can be queried by performing a `GET` operation on the `/accesses` endpoint. The query can be filted for accesses to a specific network (networkId) or for certain devices.

    A specific device access of the API consumer can be queried by performing a `GET` operation on the `/accesses/{accessId}` endpoint, where the accessId has been obtained during the _create_ procedure.

    # Deleting a device accesses

    A specific device access of the API consumer can be deleted by performing a `DELETE` operation on the `/accesses/{accessId}` endpoint. Deletion of the access can be interpreted as removal of the access permissions.

    # Creating a device group

    A Device Group is created by performing a `POST` operation on the `/device-groups` endpoint.

    The API Consumer provides the following information

    - list of devices included in the device group (which may be empty)

    - optionally, a name for the device group

    - optionally, a description of the device group

    The API returns a deviceGroupId which is needed to query, modify, and delete the Device Group.

    # Reading a device group

    A specific device group of the API consumer can be read by performing a `GET` operation on the `/device-groups/{deviceGroupId}` endpoint, where the deviceGroupId has been obtained during the _create_ procedure.

    # Modifying a device group

    A Device Group can be modified by performing a `PATCH` operation on the `/device-groups/{deviceGroupId}` endpoint. The operation complies with the standard JSON PATCH operation specified in IETF RFC 6902.

    The API Consumer may modify the following information

    - the list of devices included in the device group (which may be empty). Modification of the list can be interpreted as modification of the access permissions.

    - the name for the device group

    - the description of the device group

    # Deleting a device group

    A specific device group of the API consumer can be deleted by performing a `DELETE` operation on the `/device-groups/{deviceGroupId}` endpoint. Deletion of the device group will fail if the device group is used in any device access.

    ## Error handling

    - If the device group is used (referred to) by any access, then the server will return an error with the `409 RESOURCE_IN_USE` error code.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    Device:
      description: |
        End-user equipment able to connect to a mobile network. Examples of devices include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.
            The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:
            * `ipv4Address`
            * `ipv6Address`
            * `phoneNumber`
            * `networkAccessIdentifier`
            NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
            NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:

        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
